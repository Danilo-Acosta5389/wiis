# WhatIs___Space project
A full-stack project, consisting of a working back end (database and api) and front end in react.js. All hosted in a raspberry pi 4.
## About
The website (currently at <a href="https://wiis.ddns.net" target="_blank">wiis.ddns.net</a>, we’re seeking a new domain) - or web application if you will - is a full-stack project in every sense of the notion. It is presently hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4B with 8 GB of RAM, situated in a student apartment in Stockholm, Sweden. This diminutive machine, not much larger than a deck of cards, runs the Debian-based Linux distribution, Raspberry PI OS (Operative System). This, in turn, operates the NGINX reverse proxy server, which is the actual server opening ports 80 and 443 to any web browser with an internet connection.

The entire project consists of a Single Page Application (SPA), written in React.js and a web API (Application programming interface) which is a ASP.NET Core 6 MVC project written in C#. The database (DB) that the web API utilizes for all CRUD (Create, Reade, Update and Delete) functionality is the MySQL derivative called MariaDB. MariaDB, a small yet scalable SQL database, is deemed perfect for this purpose (in my opinion).

Currently, your web browser receives only a React.js SPA that doesn't offer much. However, it marks the beginning of what will evolve into a fully-fledged system, an essential building block to where people will navigate to explore and read about cool tech and art stuff. A place where users will interact through our forum, participate in diverse art projects and ultimately contribute to what will become our great online theater.
