# What Is Space Project

## Overview

The **What Is Space project** is a comprehensive full-stack web application hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4B with 8 GB of RAM. It encompasses both a functional back end, composed of a database and API, and a front end built with React.js. This diminutive Raspberry Pi, located in a student apartment in Stockholm, Sweden, operates as a web server running the Debian-based Linux distribution, Raspberry Pi OS. The NGINX reverse proxy server, managed by Raspberry Pi OS, facilitates the exposure of ports 80 and 443 to enable seamless access to the web application from any internet-connected browser.

## Website

Visit [whatisspace.online](https://whatisspace.online/) to experience the full-stack project in action. This web application is not just a website; it serves as a hub for a diverse range of content related to technology and art. Presently, it provides a React.js Single Page Application (SPA), offering a glimpse into the project's potential.

## Technical Stack

The project's architecture is built on the following technologies:

- **Front End:** The user interface is crafted using React.js, providing a dynamic and responsive Single Page Application.

- **Back End API:** The server-side logic is implemented in ASP.NET Core 6 MVC, written in C#. This API handles data retrieval, storage, and manipulation.

- **Database:** MariaDB, a scalable SQL database and a derivative of MySQL, is employed for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations within the web API.

## Current Status

At present, the web application primarily offers a React.js SPA, setting the foundation for future expansion. While it may seem modest, it is a vital precursor to a fully-fledged system. The ultimate vision includes an interactive forum, diverse art projects, and a collaborative online theater, creating a space where users can explore, engage, and contribute to a community centered around technology and art.
